# NyxVault

**End-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge file sharing.**

Encrypt in your browser. Share a link. The server never sees your data.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption** — files are encrypted in the browser/CLI with Argon2id + XSalsa20-Poly1305 (TweetNaCl). The server only ever stores ciphertext.
- 🧠 **Zero-knowledge** — your passphrase and the plaintext never leave your device. Not the filename, not the content type, nothing.
- 🖼️ **In-browser preview** — images, video, audio, PDF and text are previewed right after decryption, before you download.
- 🔥 **Burn after reading** — optional self-destruct: the file is permanently deleted from the server the moment it's first successfully decrypted.
- ⏳ **Expiring links** — 1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or never. Expired files are purged automatically.
- 🛡️ **VirusTotal scan** — optional, privacy-preserving: only the SHA-256 hash of the decrypted file is sent to VirusTotal — never the file itself.
- ▦ **QR code sharing** — open any download link on your phone by scanning a QR code.
- 📦 **Large files** — chunked streaming encryption handles big files without eating all your RAM.
- 🌌 **It looks like Nyx** — a cosmic lobster theme, because why should encryption be boring.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Requirements
- Node.js 18+

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabudde/nyxvault.git
cd nyxvault
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Configure

Edit `.env` and set **your own** values:

```ini
PORT=3870
API_KEY=<generate a long random string>
WEB_PASSWORD=<your web UI password>
SESSION_SECRET=<generate a long random string>
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=100
VT_API_KEY=        # optional, enables VirusTotal scanning
```

Generate random secrets quickly:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

> ⚠️ **There is no default passphrase.** Every file is protected by a passphrase **you** choose at upload time. Choose a strong, unique one — it is the only thing standing between an attacker and your data. NyxVault cannot recover it for you.

### Run

```bash
node server.js
# 🔐 NyxVault running on http://127.0.0.1:3870
```

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` — put a reverse proxy (Caddy, nginx, Traefik) with TLS in front of it for public access.

## 📖 Usage

### Web UI

1. Open `http://your-host/admin` and log in with `WEB_PASSWORD`.
2. Drag & drop a file, pick an expiry, optionally tick **🔥 Burn after reading**.
3. Enter an encryption passphrase → **Encrypt & Upload**.
4. Share the generated `/dl/<token>` link **and the passphrase** (over a separate channel!).

### Download

Anyone with the link opens it, enters the passphrase, and the file is decrypted **in their browser**. They get a preview, a VirusTotal check, and a download button. If the file was set to *burn after reading*, it's destroyed on the server the moment it's decrypted.

### CLI

```bash
export NYXVAULT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export NYXVAULT_URL="https://your-host"      # optional, defaults to https://nyxvault.org

# Upload (expiry + passphrase + burn are all optional)
node nyx-upload.js secret.pdf 24h 'my strong passphrase' burn

# Decrypt a downloaded blob
node nyx-decrypt.js encrypted.bin 'my strong passphrase' output.pdf
```

## 🔒 Security Model

| Property | How |
|---|---|
| **Encryption** | Argon2id (16 MB, 3 iterations) derives a key from your passphrase; XSalsa20-Poly1305 (`nacl.secretbox`) encrypts the data. |
| **Where** | 100% client-side — browser or CLI. The server receives only ciphertext. |
| **Filename privacy** | The original filename and content type are themselves encrypted; the server stores `redacted`. |
| **Passphrase** | Never transmitted. Not stored. Not recoverable. |
| **VirusTotal** | Only the SHA-256 hash of the *decrypted* bytes is sent — computed client-side. The file is never uploaded to VT. |
| **Burn after reading** | The server only deletes the file after the client confirms a *successful* decryption, so a wrong passphrase can never destroy a file. |
| **Transport** | Bind to localhost + TLS-terminating reverse proxy. Strict CSP, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, no inline third-party scripts. |
| **Rate limiting** | Upload, login and download endpoints are rate-limited against brute force. |

### What the server *can* see
The ciphertext, the file size, the upload time, and (optionally) an expiry timestamp. That's it.

### What the server *cannot* see
The plaintext, the filename, the content type, or your passphrase.

> NyxVault is built to minimize trust in the server. But you still trust the code that runs in your browser. Self-host it, read the source, and serve it over HTTPS.
